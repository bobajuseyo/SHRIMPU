# 🦐 SHRIMPU — AI Shrimp Species Classifier App

**SHRIMPU** is a cross-platform mobile application designed to classify shrimp species  
using **image recognition** and **deep learning** technologies.  
It enables users to identify shrimp types quickly and accurately through a built-in smartphone camera interface.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- 📸 Capture or upload images from the gallery for shrimp classification  
- 🔍 Real-time inference using a **CNN model (TensorFlow/Keras)**  
- 📊 Display prediction results with species name and confidence score  
- 🌐 **Multilingual UI** with fully **responsive design**  
- 🧠 Confidence-based logic to handle uncertain predictions and enhance reliability  

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native  
- **Backend/API:** Flask / FastAPI (Python), Keras + TensorFlow model (`.h5`)  
- **Image Processing:** Pillow for preprocessing (resize and normalization)  
- **Model:** CNN trained on multiple shrimp species datasets —  
  e.g., *White-leg shrimp*, *Banana shrimp*, *Tiger shrimp*
